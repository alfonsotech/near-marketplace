# near-marketplace
NEAR Marketplace was made following the NEAR Development 101 tutorial found here:
https://dacade.org/communities/near/courses/near-101

I wrote the contract, following the demos, and most of the front-end code was provided by the tutorial.
I have combined the NEAR-marketplace-contract and the NEAR-marketplace d'App into a single git repository here. 
To run the  NEAR-marketplace d'App, use node-version-manager to install and run Node 12, 14, or 16, as it will not run with current Node veresion (18). The "cd" into your " NEAR-marketplace" directory and use "yarn start" to deploy the front-end d'App.
